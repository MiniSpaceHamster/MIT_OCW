# MIT_OCW 6.0001 Introduction To Computer Science And Programming In Python: Problem Set 3
Beginner solutions to MIT open courseware.
Problem Set 3 is a walkthrough lesson on coding a rudamentary word game.
Most of the files are provided in the course materials; however, I wrote files for specific modules to test them individualy.
I am a beginner programmer so I have many inconsistancies as I learn and progress my knowlede.
I am providing my solutions to the problem so that I can get feedback, or also help others doing the same thing as I am.
